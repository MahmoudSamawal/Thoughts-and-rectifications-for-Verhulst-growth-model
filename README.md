# Thoughts and rectifications for Verhulst growth model: A scientific mathematization for a general theory of growth led to a fundamental law of growth
This is a research article on growth modeling in which I used Euler's method to solve the differential equation of the model I developed. The fancy thing here is using Euler's method to solve an autonomous differential equation numerically.

# Thoughts and rectifications for Verhulst growth model: A scientific mathematization for a general theory of growth led to a fundamental law of growth
This python program is a computational mathematics algorithm that is analogous in its function to Euler's method. Developed to solve a first order autonomous differential equation numerically. The program includes an application for solving the differential equation involved in the growth modeling research paper, whose preprint version: Samawal, Mahmoud, Thoughts and Rectifications for Verhulst Growth Model: a Scientific Mathematization for a General Theory of Growth Led to a Fundamental Law of Growth (May 15, 2023).
